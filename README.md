This repository collects essential Python scripts that demonstrate the core foundations of cybersecurity, automation, and system-level programming. Each script performs a practical task commonly used by cybersecurity professionals and system administrators—ranging from command-line argument handling and SHA-256 hashing to file encryption, process monitoring, log analysis, and system information extraction. Together, these tools provide a compact yet powerful introduction to real-world security automation and Python-based system operations.
