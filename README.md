This repository brings together a collection of essential Python scripts that demonstrate the practical foundations of cybersecurity, automation, and system-level programming. Each file serves a unique purpose, yet together they represent real-world tasks that cybersecurity professionals, system administrators, and automation engineers perform daily. The project covers critical concepts such as command-line argument handling, file encryption, hashing, process monitoring, log analysis, and system information extraction. For example, the argument parser script implements SHA-256 hashing to show how input integrity and data security checks work in practice
